# Programming school

## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to teach my kids to program.
So I set them up with laptops and we all sit around the table.

There is a growing list of lessons here, starting with lesson 1.

There are directories for each child that allows them to keep their code isolated, but I am encouraging cross interaction. The purpose of this is to also teach them how to use editor and how to use github.

## Setup

Each student needs:
- github account
- laptop
  
Each laptop needs:
- java 11
- VS Code
- git client
